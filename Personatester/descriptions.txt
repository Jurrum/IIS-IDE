Baseline Workflow In the existing 3D print farm, operators shoulder all manual tasks—refilling filament, removing finished prints, performing routine maintenance, and troubleshooting job errors—while relying on a static dashboard that displays the entire print queue, every printer’s status, and all alerts at once. Because there is no contextual filtering, operators must scan dense screens to identify which actions are urgent or relevant. This fixed interface design forces them to juggle multiple priorities in their heads, switching between tasks based on memory and experience alone. As print volume and the number of users grow, these fragmented workflows lead to frequent delays, missed maintenance, and overlooked print errors. The cognitive burden of manually interpreting raw status data increases error rates and causes bottlenecks, ultimately reducing throughput and making it difficult to scale the system effectively.


New Scenario Upon logging into the system, operators immediately see a streamlined, color‐coded dashboard that surfaces only their highest‐priority tasks—printer errors, low‐filament alerts, or urgent job changes—while filtering out irrelevant information. If a printer requires maintenance, AR glasses automatically overlay clear, step‐by‐step visual instructions directly onto the physical machine, highlighting components like nozzles or bed adjustments and confirming each completed step in real time. Simultaneously, embedded sensors and machine‐learning algorithms continuously analyze printer data to predict issues—filament shortages, nozzle clogs, or hardware malfunctions—before they occur. These predictive alerts appear visually and audibly with recommended actions, allowing operators to address problems proactively. Over time, user feedback refines the interface’s adaptability, ensuring that the display remains optimally simplified, further reducing cognitive load and maximizing print throughput.
