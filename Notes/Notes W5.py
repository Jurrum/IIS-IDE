Assignment - 

Lecture notes:
Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
- HCI is combining 3 main areas
    - Computer Science
    - Cognitive Science
    - Human Factors Enngineering
    - HCI in NL is considered a Psychology discipline
    - There is ALWAYS a component of Evaluation

- Good HCI:
    - improves efficienycy, safety, user trust
   - aligining interfaces with cognitive demands
   -  

- history
    - 1940 punchards
    - 1960 CLI, command line interface
    - 1970 GUI, graphical user interface
    - 2010 NUI, natural user interface

Adaptive systems
- 'automatic adaptation to the user'


- Industrial interfaces
    - Clarity
    - REpsonseives
    - Error recovery

- SCADA, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system

- MAking something fully software based can intoruce massive potential risks
- Hardware safety measures (like installing a fuse) must be taken into account

- Affordances & Signifiers
    - Affordance: the properties of an object that determine how it could be used
    - Signifier: a sign that communicates the affordance of an object

- Feedback loops & Perceived Control
    - User action
    - Feedback
    - Modalities
    - Trust increases, the more a user interacts with a system with the same expected outcome

- Mental Models in Complex Environements
    - what we believe will occur

- visibility & mapping
    - 
- Consistency, Constraints & Discoverability

- Cognitive Workload

- Information ARchitecture
    - F Pattern, with a lot of text
    - Z pattern, with a lot of images

- Interaction design
