Intelligent Interactive Systems 

---- Introduction -----

1. System theory and fundamentals
    - Whatis a system?
        - elements, interact, to create functions
        - different types of system
            - natural, tehcnical, cuber-physcial, social, socialtechnical, complex (systems of systems)
            - Industry 5.0: human-centric, sustainable, resilient
            - Industry 4.0: cyber-physical systems, IoT, AI, big data, cloud computing

    -   System Anatomy
        - Components
        - Interactions
        - Sturcture
        - Boundaries
        - Function/purpose: why does it exist
        - Isolated System, Closed System, Open System -> in relation to outside world
        - 
    - System Measures
        - Complexity -> number of elements and interactions
        - Entropy -> Disorder or uncertainty 
        - Emergence -> new properties or behaviours that arise from the interactions of the system's components
        - Feedback / Strength -> Influence of outputs on future system states
        - Delay -> time between input and output
        - Adaptability -> Ability to adjust to change
        - Resilience -> capacity to recover from disturbances
        - Connectivity -> degree of interdependence among components
        - Redundancy -> backup elements or pathways
    
    - System Thinking Principles
        - Holism -> the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
        - Interconnectedness -> all elements are connected and influence each other
        - Feedback Loops -> reinforcing changes may grow or destory the system
        - Emergence -> new properties or behaviours that arise from the interactions of the system's components
        - Causality -> small changes can have large effects
        - Dynamic Complexity -> systems are dynamic and consciously evolving
        - System Archetypes -> identofy common patterns early
        - Mental Models -> perceptions, beliefs,and expectations influence how a system is perceived
        - Leverage Points -> where small changes achieve significant improvements

    - System Archetypes
        - "Fixes that fail" -> short-term solutions that create long-term problems
            - i.e. working 10 hours instead of 8
        - "Shifting the burden" -> relying on symptomatic solutions instead of addressing the root cause
            - i.e. taking painkillers instead of treating the cause of the pain
        - "Tragedy of the commons" -> pursuing individual self-interest leads to collective harm
            - i.e. overfishing in a shared lake

    - System Designer (an identity)
        - navigate relationships
        - impact drive - long term outcomes
        - Facilitators of collaboration / translators acorss discplines
        - change management / adaptive learners

2. Intellgient interactive systems

    - What makes a system intelligent?
        - responsiveness
        - Context awareness
        - Continuous improvement

    - Dimensions of intelligence
        - sensing and percepiton
        - reasoning and decision making
        - learning and adaptation
        - action and interaction

    - Human in the loop
        - Human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems are designed to incorporate human feedback and decision-making 
        into the system's processes.
        - explicit learning / controls
        - Different from Human ON the Loop
        - Human in the loop: the human makes the decisions / trains the 

3. IIS in Manufacturing

    - Combining intelligence and interactivity
        - Aim is to augment  human abilities not replace
        - synergy not substitution

    - Designing IIS requires
        - Empathy
        - TEchnical fluency
        - System thinking


    - chellenges in manufacturing
        - Lean vs Agile
        - complex, global supply chains
        - need for customization
        - workforce augmentation
        - emphasis on sustainability and zero defect
        - energy costs
        - tariffs, geopolitics, de-globalization

    -  IIS in manufacturing
        - predictive maintenance -> reactive, planned, proactive, predictive
        - real time process opimization
        - human-robot collaboration
        - AR/XR interface for training and repairs

4. IIS in Healthcare
5. IIS in Energy
6. Course Organization

- energy supply - next 1-2 years
- Water supply in the next 3 years
