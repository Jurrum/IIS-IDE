1. The step-by-step instructions displayed on the dashboard for replacing the printer cartridge are:
- Step 1: Open the printer cover.
- Step 2: Remove the old cartridge.
- Step 3: Insert the new cartridge.
- Step 4: Close the printer cover.

2. The dashboard assists me in identifying the correct printer cartridge for replacement by:
- Displaying a visual guide with images of the compatible cartridges.
- Providing a barcode scanner option to scan the cartridge for verification.

3. The dashboard adapts if it detects I am feeling stressed or overloaded during the task by:
- Simplifying the interface to focus only on the essential steps for cartridge replacement.
- Providing calming visual cues or messages to reduce stress levels.

2. You are required to replace a component in one of the machines. As you activate the camera for guidance, the AR overlays accurately highlight the components on the machine, making the replacement process smooth and error-free.

3. While working, you feel a bit stressed due to the high workload. The dashboard responds by simplifying itself, hiding unnecessary information, and focusing only on the essential tasks, helping reduce your cognitive overload.

4. The system accurately detects your location within the assembly area using BLE beacons, ensuring that it displays only the relevant printers and part bins compatible with your current task.

5. Overall, you find the adaptive dashboard to be a valuable tool in enhancing your productivity and reducing errors in your assembly tasks.

The dashboard on your tablet displays a step-by-step checklist for the assembly process, highlighting the components you need to install next. The system detects your stress levels through your Empatica E4 wristband and simplifies the interface when necessary. You need to replace a specific part that requires guidance. The tablet's camera activates AR overlays to assist you in identifying and replacing the part correctly.

As an Operator, I log into the dashboard to check the print queue and printer statuses. I notice that the display shows all printers at once without any filtering options. I have to scan through the entire list to identify which printers need attention, leading to potential delays and missed tasks.

After spending some time scanning the dashboard, I identify a printer that requires filament refilling. I proceed to attend to that task and then return to the dashboard to check for any alerts or errors.

Upon reviewing the dashboard again, I notice an alert for a print error on a different printer. I address the issue promptly and mark it as resolved on the dashboard.

Finally, I complete my tasks for the shift and log out of the dashboard.

Task 2: Interact with the dashboard to complete a task.

I proceed to interact with the dashboard to complete a task, replacing a nozzle on a machine. The AR overlays provide clear guidance, highlighting components and confirming each step. The step-by-step checklist simplifies the process, reducing cognitive load. The adaptive nature of the dashboard streamlines my workflow and minimizes distractions.

Task 3: Reflect on the overall experience with the dashboard.

Overall, the adaptive dashboard significantly enhances my productivity and reduces errors by providing context-aware information tailored to my needs. The real-time tracking of stress levels and location-based customization ensure a seamless user experience. The combination of technology, such as BLE beacons and AR overlays, creates a dynamic and efficient workflow environment.

The dashboard recognizes your location and the task at hand, providing you with a step-by-step guide on how to replace the ink cartridge.

Task 2: While working on replacing the ink cartridge, the system detects an increase in your stress levels based on the data from your Empatica E4 wristband. The interface simplifies itself, focusing only on the essential steps of the ink cartridge replacement process, reducing unnecessary information to help you manage the task better.

Task 3: After successfully replacing the ink cartridge, the dashboard prompts you to confirm the completion of the task. You use the tablet's camera to scan the barcode on the new ink cartridge, which triggers the system to update the inventory and mark the task as completed.

Task 4: As you finish the task and move to the assembly area, the dashboard seamlessly transitions to display information relevant to the new location, ensuring that you have the necessary guidance for the next stage of production.

Task 5: In the assembly area, you are tasked with assembling components for a new product. The dashboard provides you with real-time feedback on your progress, highlighting any potential errors or missed steps to improve your efficiency and accuracy.

Task 6: Throughout your shift, the dashboard continues to adapt to your needs, providing support and guidance tailored to each task and location, ultimately enhancing your overall performance and reducing the risk of errors.

Task 1:
- The current print queue is displayed prominently on the dashboard, with each job listed in order.
- The color-coded status indicators make it easy to differentiate between active, paused, and completed prints.
- The lack of contextual filtering means all jobs are visible at once, requiring a scan of the entire queue to find specific information.

Task 2:
- Alerts for each printer are shown alongside their status, but there is no prioritization based on severity or urgency.
- Operators need to visually scan all printer alerts to identify the one requiring immediate attention, leading to potential delays in response time.

Task 3:
- The maintenance schedule for each printer is available but requires manual inspection to determine upcoming tasks.
- There is no automated alert for pending maintenance, increasing the risk of missed or delayed servicing.
